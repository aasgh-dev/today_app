Complete Tasks: Mark tasks as done by tapping the checkbox. The text is visually updated with a strikethrough.

Delete Tasks: Long-press on a task to delete it from the list.

Provider State Management: The app uses the provider package to efficiently manage and update the application state.

Dynamic Task Count: The task count on the main screen updates automatically as you add or delete tasks.

Clean UI: A user-friendly and visually appealing interface.

🚀 How It Works
